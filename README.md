## Requirements
* SilverStripe framework >3.1.2
* SilverStripe cms >3.1.2

## Version
1.1

## Documentation
Very simple gallery solution to upload images and display them in a basic gallery using Fancybox. 

A __gallery can be added to any page type__, GalleryPage is shipped with this module as an example.

Uses customised UploadField to manage the images, allowing bulk upload of images then resorting using drag drop and editing of captions inline.

An example implementation using Fancybox2 has been provided.
You are required to [purchase a licence for Fancybox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/#license) for commercial websites. Fancybox can be replaced easily for each page type you apply the gallery to.

## Installation Instructions

### Composer
1. ```composer require hpmewes/silverstripe-gallery```
2. Visit yoursite.com/dev/build?flush=1 to rebuild the database (you may need to do this twice).

### Manual
1. Place this directory in the root of your SilverStripe installation, rename the folder 'gallery'.
2. Visit yoursite.com/dev/build?flush=1 to rebuild the database (you may need to do this twice).

## Usage
1. Create "Gallery page" in the CMS
2. Edit the gallery page and go to "Gallery" tab
3. Drag images into the "Drop" area
4. [Edit caption for images](http://i.imgur.com/h8EwN.png)
5. [Drag and drop images to re-order them](http://i.imgur.com/vPrX3.png)

### Extended usage
You can make any page type a gallery by applying the extensions in this module to a page type. Using GalleryPage as an example:

#### Create a page type 
Including Javascript in your controller to display the images in your gallery and a DataObject representing the join table. Because we are applying an extension with a many_many Images component you will need a DataObject {PageType}_Images to represent the join. This object requires Caption and SortOrder fields.

```php
<?php

class GalleryPage extends Page {

}

class GalleryPage_Controller extends Page_Controller {
	
	public function init() {
		parent::init();

		Requirements::javascript('gallery/javascript/jquery-1.7.1.min.js');
		Requirements::javascript('gallery/javascript/jquery.fancybox.js');
		Requirements::javascript('gallery/javascript/GalleryPage.js');

		Requirements::css('gallery/css/jquery.fancybox.css');
	}
}

class GalleryPage_Images extends DataObject {
	
	static $db = array (
		'PageID' => 'Int',
		'ImageID' => 'Int',
		'Caption' => 'Text',
		'SortOrder' => 'Int'
	);
}
```

_You may need to run /dev/build twice during this process to ensure the join object is created correctly._

#### Create a template
Using the GalleryPage.ss layout template as an example, loop through the ordered images and display them with necessary markup for your lightbox Javascript.
```html
<% loop OrderedImages %>
	<a class="fancybox" data-fancybox-group="gallery" href="$Filename" title="$Caption">
		$SetSize(250,250)
	</a>
<% end_loop %>
```

#### Apply the extension
Apply the extension to the page type in a config yaml file:
```yaml
GalleryPage:
  extensions: 
    - 'Gallery_PageExtension'
```

#### Usage in frontend
Create your Form like following example
```php
class GalleryPage_Controller extends Page_Controller {

    ...
    
    public function GalleryImageForm() {
        $urlParams = $this->getURLParams();
        // Todo: join doesn't work
        $images = Image::get()->leftJoin('GalleryPage_Images', 'GalleryPageID = '.$urlParams['ID']);
        
        $fields = new FieldList(
            new HiddenField('GalleryPageID', 'GalleryPageID', $urlParams['ID']),
            $galleryUploadField = new GalleryUploadField('Images', '')
        );
        // existing files can't be added
        $galleryUploadField->setCanAttachExisting(false);

        $actions = new FieldList(new FormAction('doSaveImage', 'Bild/er speichern'));
        
        return new Form($this, 'GalleryImageForm', $fields, $actions, null);
    }
 
    /**
     * save the image relations in db
     * 
     * @param type $data
     * @param Form $form
     * @return type
     */
    public function doSaveImage($data, Form $form) {
        $files = $data['Images']['Files'];
        $galleryPageID = $data['GalleryPageID'];
        
        // foreach submitted file
        foreach($files as $fileID) {
            $image = Image::get()->filter('ID', $fileID)->first();
            // create relation between images and objektpage
            $galleryPageImage = new GalleryPage_Images();
            $galleryPageImage->Caption = $image->Title;
            $galleryPageImage->ImageID = $image->ID;
            $galleryPageImage->GalleryPageID = $galleryPageID;
            $galleryPageImage->write();
        }
        return $this->redirectBack();
    }

    /**
     * delete a image from db and upload folder
     * 
     * @return type
     */
    public function delete_image() {
        $urlParams = $this->getURLParams();
        // remove image from db
        Image::delete_by_id('Image', $urlParams['ID']);
        
        return $this->redirectBack();
    }
```

```html
$galleryPageImage
```
